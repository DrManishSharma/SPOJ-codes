# SPOJ-codes
Codes of different problems on www.spoj.com website

How come this readme file is different from the master file. They shoule ideally be same, isn't it. It seems I made correction in the master file something which I shouldn't have done. 

# I will use c++(gcc8.3) to solve the problems. All the problems will be labeled with the same name as in the SPOJ challenge.
